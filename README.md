# face_tracker
simple face tracking script for streaming

This code tracks the user's face through a camera and allows the user to select which audio input to use.

The image overlayed will switch between 2 png files based on if the user is speaking or not (the audio levels are adjustable).

When the program is run, the frames will be sent to the virtual camera which can be selected in a streaming software like OBS.


Below are 2 frames showcasing the movement and the 2 png images being toggled based on the audio.
